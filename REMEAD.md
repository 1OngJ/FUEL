# FUEL

**FUEL** is a hierarchical framework for **F**ast **U**AV **E**xp**L**oration.
It contains a Frontier Information Structure (FIS), which can be incrementally updated with the online built map and facilitate exploration planning in high frequency.
Based on FIS, a hierarchical planner plans optimal global coverage paths, refine local viewpoints, and generates minimum-time local trajectories successively.  
Our method is demonstrated to complete challenging exploration tasks **3-8 times** faster than state-of-the-art approaches.
